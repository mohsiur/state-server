# State-Server

The following is my attempt at solving the state-server problem set by Vistar Media. I enjoyed this challenge and learnt a lot while attempting this problem.

## Installation

The following methods can be used to get the server up running, it will be located at `http://localhost:8080/home`

### Jar Installation

Through the terminal run the following command after downloading the [jar](target/state-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)
`java -jar state-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### Import as maven project

The file can also be imported as a maven project and run through eclipse or any IDE. Main application is Application.java.
